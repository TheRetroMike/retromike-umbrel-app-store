description: >-
  Run your own self-hosted Litecoin + Dogecoin merged mining pool on Umbrel OS.
  Merged mining allows you to mine both LTC and DOGE simultaneously using the
  same Scrypt hashpower — one effort, two rewards.

  This package includes everything you need: Litecoin Core node, Dogecoin Core
  node, a high-performance merged mining stratum server (from dreams-money),
  PostgreSQL database, and a web dashboard.

  Point your Scrypt ASIC miners (Antminer L7/L9, Goldshell, etc.) at your
  Umbrel server and earn both LTC and DOGE from every hash.

  Features: Full merged mining (AuxPoW), Stratum server with 1000+ client
  support, ZMQ real-time block notifications, automatic payouts, PostgreSQL
  backed statistics, and a simple web status page.

  WARNING: Solo mining LTC/DOGE requires significant hashpower. With a small
  miner this is effectively lottery mining. Consider this for learning,
  privacy, or supporting the networks.
