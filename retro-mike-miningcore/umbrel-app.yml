  This is the Miningcore pool from https://github.com/oliverw/miningcore.

  It can be used for many sha256 coins based on Bitcoin Core; including MultiFlex Coin (MFLEX).

  The app auto-initializes the required Postgres database + schema and renders
  /home/umbrel/.miningcore/config.json from pool fragments in /home/umbrel/.miningcore/pools.d/.

  Workflow on Umbrel:
  1) Install Postgres
  2) Install MiningCore
  3) Install coin node apps (e.g., MFLEX Node) to auto-register pools
  You can change or remove the fee at any time by editing:
  /home/umbrel/.miningcore/fees.json
