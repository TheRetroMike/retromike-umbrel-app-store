  Full node and wallet for MultiFlex Coin.

  On install this app will:
  - create/load a dedicated wallet ("pool") if needed
  - generate a **legacy** pool address
  - register the MFLEX pool in the "MiningCore (MFLEX)" app automatically

  The node itself starts WITHOUT -wallet on first boot (so fresh installs never crash because a wallet is missing).
  As soon as the wallet exists, it will auto-load it on restarts.
